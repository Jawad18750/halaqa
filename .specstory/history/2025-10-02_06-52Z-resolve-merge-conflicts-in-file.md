Resolved all 3 merge conflicts in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

1. **Lines 11-14**: Removed conflict markers and kept the clean checkout step
2. **Lines 29-42**: Kept the complete artifact preparation with `.htaccess` for SPA routing
3. **Lines 57-60**: Removed trailing conflict markers and empty lines

The workflow now includes:
- Node.js setup and build steps
- Artifact preparation with `.htaccess` for SPA routing
- SSH deployment with zero-downtime symlink strategy

Ready to commit and push.
